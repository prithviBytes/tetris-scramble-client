Those are:
2 - Install PostgresDB (and pgadmin) if you haven't already.
- Set up environment variables above to connect to the database and API.
   - Example of database connectionstring: 
   `postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/dbname`
2.1 Create .env file in server directory 
	DATABASE_URL = <database-connection-string>
- Install sequelize CLI using `npm install -g sequelize-cli`.
- Run `sequelize db:migrate` to apply the latest database changes.
1. in root folder open cli and run "npm run dev". That will build both backend and
frontend and populate it with environment variables that can be changed manually (for client - in client root dir, server - server root dir).
	Those default variables are:
	
	*client*:
	REACT_APP_API_BASE_ADDRESS=http://localhost:8079

	*server*:
	JWT_SECRET=asm424rsfcsr34fw34cftw4oSDs9dsNSONds
	REACT_CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000

3.run "node index.js" from root folder to start server
4.run "npm start" from client folder to start client
